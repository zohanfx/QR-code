## My process

First of all I started doing the HTML process creating a div and a container where I'll put all the class and ID's to make everything on CSS style.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learned how to make efficient ways to call classes from HTLM standing on CSS.
Also to use more Google when is needed

### Continued development

I think the most important thing here is put all knowledge together and start making thing, So starting implement other tools as react, etc.

### Useful resources

All useful things are in Google and StackOverflow
